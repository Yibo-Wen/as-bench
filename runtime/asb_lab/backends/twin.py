"""Digital-twin backend: a campaign-supplied process model stands in for the lab.

``config["module"]`` is a Python file inside the lab image (never the agent
image), relative to the campaign directory. It may use third-party packages
installed in the lab image; the runtime itself stays stdlib-only. It defines:

``measure(stage, designs, output_dir, uploads) -> list[dict]``
    Measure one accepted batch and return one result row per design, in
    order: ``{<design_id_field>: name, <measurement>: value-or-file-name}``.
    File measurements are written into ``output_dir``. Any noise must be seeded
    deterministically from the stage and batch position, so rerunning a
    campaign with the same designs reproduces the same measurements.

``validate_upload(stage, upload) -> None`` (optional)
    Raise ``ValueError`` for a malformed design. Invalid batches are rejected
    before a stage is consumed.

``validate_deliverable(data) -> None`` (optional)
    Raise ``ValueError`` for a malformed binary deliverable.

``measure`` runs in a background thread: the job reports ``running`` until it
returns, so slow simulations look like a real instrument queue to the agent.
A measurement error fails the job without consuming the stage.
