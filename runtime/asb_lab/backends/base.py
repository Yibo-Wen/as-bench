"""Backend contract shared by the replay, digital-twin, and live backends.

The lab server owns everything the agent can observe: campaign rules, budget,
stage order, eligibility, idempotency, and the ledger. A backend only turns an
accepted batch of designs into measurements. Swapping backends therefore
cannot change the agent-facing API or the task semantics.

Measurements may arrive synchronously (replay) or later (twin, live). The
server calls :meth:`Backend.submit` once per accepted job and, while the job is
not terminal, :meth:`Backend.poll` whenever the agent asks for its status.
